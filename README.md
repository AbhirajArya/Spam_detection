# Spam_detection
Spam detection using machine learning involves training a model to distinguish between "spam" (unwanted or malicious messages) and "ham" (legitimate, non-spam messages). This process typically involves supervised learning, where the model is trained on a labeled dataset that contains examples of both spam and non-spam (ham) messages.
